# RL-Taxi-Driver
A Reinforcement Learning agent trained via DQNs (Deep Q-Networks) for maximizing rewards in the given environment. 

A short description of the files is as follows:
1. `Report.pdf`: Includes details on the architecture used and the results
2. `Converged_1900.h5`: A converged model, this can be used in the notebook named `RL Model Testing.ipynb`
3. `TM_lower.npy`: Contains the time matrix in numpy format, which tells time taken to go from one place to another at a given day and time. 
4. `RL Model Testing.ipynb`: This notebook can be used for testing the model.
5. `RL Model Training.ipynb`: This notebook is used for training and plotting results from the model.
